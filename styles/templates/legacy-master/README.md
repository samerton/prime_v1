# Legacy
Our old NamelessMC theme

After over a year of using this theme, I've finally decided it was in our best interest to open-source our Nameless theme. We've since taken the initiative of switching to our own software, developed by us. There is nothing wrong with Nameless, it will always be as great as it is.

I wasn't quite sure if I wanted to release this or not, but after a lot of requests (and considering it's no longer in use), I figured other people could use this as well.

# Terms

* You may not redistribute/resell this as your own.
* You may not claim this to be your own.

This isn't a requirement, but at the very least, please give us credit somewhere; it would mean a lot. (I won't give support to those that don't, just saying.)


P.S. Sorry about my CSS Class namings (it was a form of obfuscation to prevent people from code stealing, and it somewhat worked :D)
     I'm sure you'll figure it out.
